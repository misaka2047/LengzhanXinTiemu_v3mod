 space_race.1.t: "Stair to the Space"
 space_race.1.d: "After World War II, the research legacy of the Third Reich attracted scientists from various countries. The V-2 rocket, which was used for bombing southern England and Western Europe, has been proven to have the potential to enter space with equipment or astronauts."
 space_race.1.f: "The V-2 rocket (Vergeltungswaffe 2) was a long-range ballistic missile designed by Werner von Braun, a brilliant scientist from Nazi Germany. This missile was the first object to achieve suborbital flight. After the fall of the Third Reich, scientists in both the USA and the USSR began research on the V-2 missile, and their early space exploration projects were based on this research."
 space_race.1.a: "March on the space!"

 space_race.2.t: "Reach the Stars"
 space_race.2.d: "Our scientists have proven that we are able to launch an object into Earth orbit, which will orbit the Earth like an ‘artificial moon’. It will greatly promote our space research, and it may have great potential in applications such as communications, military reconnaissance, and weather monitoring."
 space_race.2.f: "Before the emergence of the Enlightenment and modern science, humanity once believed that the movements of the stars in the sky were revelations of human destiny. But today, we are attempting to place a star in the heavens ourselves. All the superstitious and unfounded myths have retreated in the face of our ambition to conquer the universe. We no longer need to rely on metaphysical forces to interpret human fate; instead, we are gradually taking control of our destiny through the development of natural science." 
 space_race.2.a: "Launch our satellite project!"

 space_race.3.t: "Manned Space Flight Plan"
 space_race.3.d: "The success of our satellite project has provided us with the experience and confidence to explore further. Our next ambitious step is manned space flight."
 space_race.3.f: "The human desire for exploration is endless. We are eager to conquer space through our courage and wisdom, just like the pioneers aboard the Mayflower."
 space_race.3.a: "We shall not be restrained by the gravity!"

 space_race.4.t: "Lunarlanding Plan"
 space_race.4.d: "Human spaceflight technology is the foundation of our ambitious plan: reach a distance of 380,000 kilometers, reaching the moon."
 space_race.4.f: "But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\n\nWe choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."
 space_race.4.a: "We choose to go to the moon!"

 space_race.5.t: "Build a Space Station"
 space_race.5.d: "Our scientists have an ambitious vision: We can build a space station in low Earth orbit as our foundation for human spaceflight. It will be our outpost for space exploration and provide a platform for complex and long-term research."
 space_race.5.f: "How rare the moon, so round and clear!\nWith cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky,\nI do not know in the celestial sphere\nWhat name this festive night goes by?\nI want to fly home, riding the air,\nBut fear the ethereal cold up there,\nThe jade and crystal mansions are so high!"
 space_race.5.a: "A groundbreaking concept!"

 space_race.6.t: "The Return Signal"
 space_race.6.d: "Our scientists have received the return signal from the satellite, which means our satellite has entered the planned orbit and is operating normally."
 space_race.6.f: "There was nothing but utter silence in the control center. Time froze until our phone rang. It was from another tracking station, which informed us that they had received the return signal from the satellite, which meant our satellite had entered the correct orbit. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. After 95 minutes, our satellite flew over the launch site, and the control center received the return signal as well."
 space_race.6.a: "Beep...Beep...Beep..."
 space_race.6.b: "Our satellite is also a success!"

 space_race.7.t: "Astronaut Enters the Orbit."
 space_race.7.d: "The spaceship with our astronaut has entered the correct Earth orbit."
 space_race.7.f: "In an taikonaut's view, Earth is not a globe, but a curve. Our spaceship flies over our country and provinces quickly, and I always look forward to the next pass. I looked down at our capital, which was a hazy grey in the daytime, but glowed red at night. My family and comrades were down there."
 space_race.7.a: "Ready for spacewalk!"

 space_race.8.t: "Spacewalk"
 space_race.8.d: "Our astronaut stepped out of the spaceship and entered the microgravity environment, which will be an epic moment in our history."
 space_race.8.f: "It is of great significance to conduct a spacewalk, which is the foundation of other space activities, such as repairing spaceships, building a space station, or conducting repairs on other spacecraft. In summary, further exploration in space is based on today’s spacewalk."
 space_race.8.a: "We checked the sky thoroughly and found no God or angels."
 space_race.8.b: "I have exited the cabin and feel good."

 space_race.9.t: "Space Station Assembled Successfully." 
 space_race.9.d: "We have built an entire space station through several launches and assembly work by astronauts."
 space_race.9.f: "The space station is humanity's home in space and a base for exploring the universe. It is not only an important platform for conducting scientific experiments, observations, and research in space, but also a place where humans can live, work, and rest."
 space_race.9.a: "Our outpost for further exploration!"

 space_race.10.t: "Land on the Moon"
 space_race.10.d: "Our spaceship landed on the moon. Our astronaut stepped out the spaceship and left the footprint of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 space_race.10.f: "They wore thickly padded white lunar walking suits, big boots, and large gloves, carrying backpacks that supplied them with oxygen and radio communication. After opening the hatch, the astronauts exited the lunar module six and a half hours after landing on the Moon. Facing away, they slowly descended the ladder of the lunar module. The astronaut stepped onto the fine powder of the lunar surface, leaving footprints in the lunar soil. Then, the astronaut uncovered the commemorative plaque on the ladder of the lunar module and planted a flag on the ground."
 space_race.10.a: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."
 space_race.10.b: "We landed on the moon!"

 space_race.11.t: "发射！"
 space_race.11.d: "经过充分的准备和一系列测试，我们终于可以准备向太空发射航天器了。"
 space_race.11.f: "火箭尾部发出巨大的轰鸣声，数百吨高能燃料开始燃烧，八台发动机同时喷出炽热的火焰，高温高速的气体，几秒钟就把发射台下的上千吨水化为蒸气。"
 space_race.11.a: "火箭升空了。"

 space_race.12.t: "Experimental Animals"
 space_race.12.d: "Our scientists plan to send animals into space and monitor their biological data, which is significant for humankind's space exploration."
 space_race.12.f: "Scientists attached sensors to the surface and under the skin of the dog to monitor its breathing and heartbeat. After entering space, the monitored data would be automatically transmitted back to the ground. Then, the scientists placed it into a pressurized and sealed cabin specially designed for it, which was secured at the rocket’s head. A camera was also positioned facing it."
 space_race.12.a: "It is necessary."
 space_race.12.b: "What a ridiculous idea!"

space_race.13.t: "Insufficient Range"
space_race.13.d: "Our rocket design has encountered an obstacle: the range of the rocket is insufficient, but the missile's fuel tank has reached its design limit and cannot accommodate more fuel."
space_race.13.f: "With the commander's order, the missile roared into the sky. However, as its trajectory became clearer, everyone's mood grew heavier. As expected, the problem appeared—the missile's range was evidently insufficient. This issue, like a bucket of cold water, dampened everyone's spirits on-site. Since the start of this missile's development, the research team has constantly faced various challenges, and the issue of insufficient range is particularly troublesome."
space_race.13.a: "Accelerate research on more efficient propellants."
space_race.13.b: "Modify the rocket layout to accommodate more fuel."
space_race.13.c: "The heavy propellant might be the reason the rocket can't go far."

space_race.14.t: "Spaceship Explosion"
space_race.14.d: "Shortly after liftoff, the external fuel tank exploded in midair, destroying the spacecraft and abruptly cutting off communication with the ground."
space_race.14.f: "All the data on the control center screens suddenly vanished. The spaceship turned into a massive fireball, and two uncontrollable solid rocket boosters separated from the fireball, flying in a V-shape with flames trailing behind them, seemingly heading towards densely populated land. The safety officer at the space center acted quickly, remotely detonating them at the 100th second."
space_race.14.a: "What a painful lesson!"

space_race.15.t: "Fueling Explosion"
space_race.15.d: "During rocket fueling, an error by the technicians led to an explosion of the fuel tank, causing the death of many technicians on site."
space_race.15.f: "Only the lessons learned from bloodshed are the most profound, and only the price paid in pain is the most costly. This explosion not only cost us a rocket but also many valuable technicians. We must remember this painful lesson and use it as a spur to continuously improve our technical skills and safety measures."
space_race.15.a: "Start over."

space_race.16.t: "Hardened O-Rings"
space_race.16.d: "A technician warned that the low temperature on the launch day would harden the O-rings used for sealing, which could have serious consequences."
space_race.16.f: "“These steel rings look solid and sturdy, but after ignition, each part, under immense pressure, will 'inflate' like a balloon. This requires using elastic bands at the joints to prevent hot gases from escaping the rocket.” This task is carried out by two rubber bands known as 'O-rings,' which can expand with the steel rings and seal the gaps. If these two rubber bands separate from the steel rings for even 0.2 seconds, the booster fuel will leak, and the solid rocket boosters will explode."
space_race.16.a: "This is a serious design flaw!"
space_race.16.b: "We can't afford any delays."

space_race.17.t: "Fairing Opened Prematurely"
space_race.17.d: "After the rocket's ascent, the fairing opened prematurely, leading to significant aerodynamic changes and the rocket losing control."
space_race.17.f: "The fairing is used to protect satellites and other payloads from harmful environments such as aerodynamic forces, aerodynamic heating, and acoustic vibrations. It is a crucial part of the launch vehicle. The satellite fairing typically has a clamshell (two-half) structure, composed of a nose cone, forward cone section, cylindrical section, aft cone section, and longitudinal and transverse separation mechanisms."
space_race.17.a: "We launched the rocket into the sea!"

space_race.18.t: "Progressing Smoothly"
space_race.18.d: "Our space mission is currently progressing smoothly."
space_race.18.f: "In this challenging era, our scientists are engaged in space exploration with unprecedented enthusiasm and courage."
space_race.18.a: "Noted."

space_race.19.t: "Making Progress"
space_race.19.d: "Our space mission is making progress, but we are also encountering some unforeseen risks."
space_race.19.f: "On the path of space exploration, we will face various difficulties and challenges, but we believe that as long as we persevere and move forward bravely, we will eventually succeed."
space_race.19.a: "Noted."

space_race.20.t: "Encountered Risks"
space_race.20.d: "The space mission is not progressing smoothly, and some unexpected risks have emerged."
space_race.20.f: "The path of the pioneers is always filled with the unknown and danger."
